# CoinGecko Price Import
This repo containes a simple webserver written in Rust using Rocket to import live prices of cryptocurrencies into Google Sheets  

## Why?
I've tried importing prices into Google sheets directly, but aparently, CoinGecko has placed limitations for
Google's IP addresses because there were a lot of requests (no surprise, google sends all requests from all google sheets from single set of IPs).  
This webserver serves as a middleman between google sheets and coingecko, so that requests to coingecko come from an IP other than Google's.

## How do I run it?
Basically, you should install Rust, clone the repo and use
```shell
cargo build --release
```
You might encounter some errors, and you might need to install some packages, like build-essentials.
Also, if you are compiling on linux, you have to have openssl installed.

## Free endpoint
I am hostig an endpoint on AWS right now (at the time of writing this readme). You can use it, if you want to, but if it will have a lot of traffic, I'll add auth and limitations.
It's available on
```
http://coingecko.tretyakov.xyz:1234/price
```
You also have to pass two parameters:
- ids_=bitcoin,ethereum (basically, comma separated list of crypto from coingecko names)
- vs_=usd (currencies to which fetch prices, also can be comma separated)

So, full link would look like this
```
http://coingecko.tretyakov.xyz:1234/price?ids_=bitcoin,ethereum&vs_=usd,aud
```
